            <li>1/4 cup yoghurt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cream</li>
            <li>1 tbsp kasuri methi</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp garam masala</li>
            <li>1 tbsp pf cream to drizzle</li>
            <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>sliced ginger and green chilies to garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rub the chicken pieces with the spice mix and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat your pan on medium heat and add once the oil shimmers then add in your onion and green chili.</li>
            <li>Saute until the edges of the onion start to change colour.</li>
            <li>Add the ginger and garlic paste, cook for a minute to get the rawness out.</li>
            <li>Now add in the tomatoes, kashmiri laal mirch, and Â½ tsp salt.</li>
            <li>Cook, covered for a few minutes to hasten the softening of the tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Uncover and cook on medium high heat to take out some of the excess moisture, when the masala comes together, it will be one cohesive delicious looking paste, then remove it from the pan. Be sure to leave some oil behind.</li>
            <li>If your blender can handle high heat liquids then you can puree it right away - otherwise wait for the mixture to cool a little. Puree the tomatoes with the 1/4 cup yoghurt.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken pieces to the pan on medium high heat and saute until the color changes completely.</li>
            <li>Stir your pureed mix back into the pan, along with half a cup of water. Bring it to a simmer and then let it cook, covered, and on low heat until the chicken is tender (20 minutes - more if needed).</li>
            <li>Add your cream to the handi and bring it to a gentle simmer.</li>
            <li>Adjust consistency to your liking and top with kasuri methi, your garam masala, a knob of butter, and taste for seasoning. This is when you can add more spice (remaining kashmiri laal mirch), salt, some tomato paste, or even a pinch of sugar to balance out the flavours.</li>
            <li>Garnish with a drizzle of cream and your favorite toppings. Serve with hot naan or basmati rice.</li>
